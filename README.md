## Project Display Example
 **Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one implementation of the minimal functionality. You are encouraged to redesign and strive for even better solutions.**

The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers:

## Project Submission
You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer.

### How will I complete this project?
1. If you haven't already, install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py) - this module has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.

For this project, you will need to submit a zip of your project files saved as `movie_website.zip`. Your zip should include three Python files: `media.py`, `entertainment_center.py`, and `fresh_tomatoes.py`. Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric.

The rubric that will be used is [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3553029266/rubric).
