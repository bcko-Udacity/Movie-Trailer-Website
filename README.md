# Movie-Trailer-Website

## Project Overview
You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

### Why this Project?
At their core, Full Stack Web Developers are programmers - you just happen to specialize in writing applications for the web! In this project, you’ll write your first application that is accessible via a web browser.

### What will I Learn?
You will learn how to write an application using object-oriented Python. You will then learn how to make this application serve HTML via a web server.

### How does this Help my Career?
You will establish a foundation in core programming concepts using Python
You will understand the role a simple web server has in receiving a request, executing a block of code and generating a response

## Project Display Example
Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one implementation of the minimal functionality. You are encouraged to redesign and strive for even better solutions.

The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers:

In this project you will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see your favorite movies and watch the trailers. You'll be writing server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. The data will then be expressed on the web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers
